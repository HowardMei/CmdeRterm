## Getting Started

* Fork the repository or download the archive to a windir such as D:/CmdeRterm (It's that easy)
* Run setup.cmd to install(uinst.cmd to uninstall) and you'll find
  Cmder Here in context menu when right click.
* That's it. If you want customization, do it in the D:/CmdeRterm/home dir.
